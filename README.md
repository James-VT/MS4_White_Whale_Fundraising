# White Whale Fundraising

## Tutorials

Tutorials that assisted me with this project include Code Institute's Boutique Ado and Hello Django. I also leaned heavily on Django's own documentation for 3.2, and on [this video from Youtuber Dennis Ivy for the donation app.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZwyA9lUwRk)

Youtube channel Codemy.com also helped me create this project. Specifically, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVEKe39VFu8&t=251s)

## Websites

Several websites with similar features were helpful to understand what sort of information might be seen on a typical charity website, for example form fields, membership types, etc. In particular, the websites of the Royal Armouries, the National Funding Scheme, and the National Trust influenced my decisions on layouts, styling and orders.
